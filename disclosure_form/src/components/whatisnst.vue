    <br />
    <div>
      Neurosomatic Therapy (NST) is an integrative form of manual therapy that identifies and corrects structural and biomechanical
  patterns in the body that cause chronic pain. Chronic pain is traditionally treated in a way that does not address the underlying soft
  tissue causes of pain. When performed in isolation, Massage Therapy, Physical Therapy, and medicinal pain management fail to
  address the entire health issue. By using careful analysis of dysfunctional postural and movement patterns to create a
  comprehensive therapy program NST fully addresses the five stages of rehabilitation: Eliminate Muscle Spasm
